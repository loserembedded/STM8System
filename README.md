# STM8System
A sample time trigger system based on STM8 

This program has done a time tick and UART command port.

Based on CPU clock 2MHz and timer4 counter just 8bit, 
time tick is 10.04 milli second could be used by programmer to dispatch different program.
It is not precise but still could work well.
